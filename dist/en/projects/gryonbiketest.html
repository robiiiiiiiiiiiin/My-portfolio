            <p><a href="https://www.bikegryon.ch/" target="blank">Gryon Bike Test</a> is a three days event where people can test a multitude of bikes brought by different bikes sellers. I leaded a three developers team during a one month school project which aim was to build a MVP application for that event. This app is a management interface for the event staff, and it's also a kind of "<s>Trip</s> Bike advisor" for the event visitors</p>
            <p><span>You can test the app with the following credentials:</span>
            <ul>
                <li>visiteur@gmail.com</li>
                <li>exposant@gmail.com</li>
                <li>admin@gmail.com</li>
            </ul>
            <span>The password is "password" for all of them</span>

            <h2><span class="tilted_bg"><span class="bg">Context</span></span></h2>
            <p>This project was the year-end project of my bachelor 2nd year. The goal was to build, in 20 days, a functionnable MVP for the <a href="https://www.bikegryon.ch/" target="blank">Gryon Bike Test</a>, allowing their staff to manage the visitors and the bikes loaning.</p>
            <p>We were a team of five people. Two of us worked on the visual / UX part, One was mainly working on the HTML / CSS, and the last person and myself worked on the backend. I was leading our three people developement team.</p>
            <p>This project was not only a coding project, we also did all the ideation to determine our concept and our functionnalities.</p>

            <h2><span class="tilted_bg"><span class="bg">Functionnalities</span></span></h2>
            <p>There are the functionnalities we implemented:</p>
            <span class="ul_title">Functionnalities for the staff</span>
            <ul>
                <li>Management of the application's users and their rights</li>
            </ul>
            <span class="ul_title">Functionnalities for the bikes sellers</span>
            <ul>
                <li>Manage their bikes catalogue</li>
                <li>Manage the bikes loaning (Who borrows which bike and when)</li>
            </ul>
            <span class="ul_title">Functionnalities for the visitors</span>
            <ul>
                <li>Buy a ticket (The payment part is fake, so it's more of a registration) / Login</li>
                <li>See all available bikes at the event with their ratings and comments</li>
                <li>Rate the bike they have tested on mutliple criterias</li>
            </ul>

            <h2><span class="tilted_bg"><span class="bg">Room for improvement</span></span></h2>
            <p>The app is a MVP. So a lot of functionnalities could be added. I'm pretty happy with the code, but some times we learnt something during the development and we didn't have time to refactor all the code. The database modeling could surely be improved as well. Also, our CSS skills were modest at that time, so the responsive and cross-browser CSS could be improved.</p>
