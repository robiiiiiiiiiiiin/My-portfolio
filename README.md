# My porfolio

I used my [HandleBabelSassPack](https://github.com/robiiiiiiiiiiiin/HandleBabelSassPack) developmment setup to build this website.  
this website is online at https://robinbecherraz.ch

The portfolio section thumbnails are generated from the /src/data/projects.json file using a template.  
Every pages in /src/html/projects use a template, and some headers are generated from templates as well.

## Installation

Clone the repository, run `npm install`, then `npm run build`, then `npm run translate`

Use `npm run watch` to compile everything on the fly

Use `npm run preview` to run a live-server auto-refreshing on every save
